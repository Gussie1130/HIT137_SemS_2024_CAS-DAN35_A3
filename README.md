## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for Group Assignment 3 of the HIT137 course for Semester S 2024 at CAS-DAN35. The project is implemented in Python and demonstrates understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles, GUI development using Tkinter, and image processing using OpenCV.

## Functional Requirements

### Image Loading

- Select and load images from the local device.
- Display the loaded image in the application window.

### Image Cropping

- Draw a rectangle using mouse interaction for image cropping.
- Provide real-time visual feedback of the selection area while drawing.
- Display the cropped result alongside the original image.

### Image Resizing

- Slider control for resizing the cropped image.
- Update the display in real-time as the user moves the slider.

### Saving the Modified Image

- Allow saving of the modified image.

## Bonus Features

- Implement additional image processing features.
- Add keyboard shortcuts.
- Implement undo/redo functionality.

## Contributions

- **Aashish** - Implemented the image loading and display features.
- **Xueqin Guo** - Developed the image cropping functionality.
- **Syed Omar Faruk** - Implemented the image resizing feature using the slider.
- **Rohan Baniya** - Added the saving functionality and coordinated the project.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Initially faced issues with installing OpenCV and Pillow in different environments.
  - **Solution:** Fixed by uninstalling them and installing in a virtual environment (venv).

- **Challenge:** Accuracy in cropping the image.
  - **Solution:** Refined the mouse interaction code to improve the precision of the cropping area.

- **Challenge:** Output window size.
  - **Solution:** Adjusted the output window size to ensure it displays the images correctly without cropping or scaling issues.
